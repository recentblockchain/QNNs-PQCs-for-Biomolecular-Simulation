2. Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) / Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for Biomolecular Simulation Core Idea: Use a parameterized quantum circuit as a neural network layer to represent the electronic wavefunction or energy landscape of a molecule or protein. The training involves tuning quantum gates to minimize an energy cost function.
